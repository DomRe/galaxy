- debug stuff
- implement serialization
	- call serializecomponetns from serailize suystem using eneityx
	- serializecomponents contain information about what this entity needs to load
	- use al_config format to easily support classes that require serialization

render gui according to screen
render world according to camera
screen is camera

each layer of a map is a bitmap
so each layer is seperate and we only render a subsection of the bitmap based off of the camera
-> then we pass that to the layering system
e.g.
layer 0 - bg
layer 1 - animated bg
layer 2 - player
layer 3 - top of tree layer

only bitmaps we update are ones marked "animated"
AnimatedTile -> Tile?
look into new tmx docs

we can then update the animations aswell.
each layer should be a bitmap so we can instert it into layer render engine
movesystem needs to grab tile information in order to make actions occur
