	- implement map limits -> camera / tilemap / player pos?

- implement serialization
	- wait on entt serialization capabilities

profile code for lags https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling
test everything - but im not writing tests for an entire game programming library... sorry... :( sandbox will be my "test"
static code analysis
review all engine warnings

debug tools - log, console (component / script editor??? -> create entity and add components functionality?
redo collisions and ensure that it can also manage collisions with map objects

or have functions that deal with a specific type of collision between two entitys? and we just manually check which is which. -> eg.g a WallCollision Function or a PoisonSwap collision function?
Can store dis data anywhar?
