Modern 2D OpenGL 4.5-ext Renderer in Modern C++.

## Notes:
- Requires C++20 compatible compiler and OpenGL 4.5+ capable GPU.
- This was created as a method to learn OpenGL and professional Software Engineering processes. Nothing says this code isnt usable but be warned there is no support, and I am not responsible if you blow up your GPU.
