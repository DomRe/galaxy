- profile code for lags https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling
- fix up and rewrite sandbox to test all parts of engine
- static code analysis
- review all compilation warnings
- integrate lua better

	https://sol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/cxx-in-lua.html

	- allow for creating entities in lua.
	- even assigning components!
- fix category headers for v1.0.
- entity creation scripts need to be generic
	- how many entitys to create of each type from each script
	- i.e. scripts are basicically templates for entity creation
	- remove concepts of unique entitys
- more physics shapes from tmx maps.
- https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/8hmn0y/can_someone_give_me_a_practical_example/ -> ecs example usage 
- loading screens between states
- resources are loaded on a differnet thread

- better code integration
	- https://github.com/algorys/cmakeconverter for travis-ci
	- appveyor also needs to have access to more compilers
- split up doxygen documentation on rtfd and take advantage of toc.
	- refer to: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html	


classes to serialize:
- music
	- serialize as part of audio resources
- transformcomponent
- physicscomponent
	- may need to update internal entity during deserialization
- rendercomponent
- anmationcomponent
- statemachine
- registry in world.hpp
- animation
- animationframe
- vector2, vector3, rect (but as types so they can be serialized, not important to serialize each one at game save / load leave it up to where they are being used).



docs notes:
- make a note in docs that when adding folder to the config file they must have a '/' on the end if they are folders.
- make a note about objects and physics in tmxmap docs with name of object being script name.
- make a note about entt destroying components and to not allocate memory using components
- make a note in docs that when making text objects in map, text fontfamily and size must be in fontbook in format: fontfamilySize and that parse code will remove spaces first.
	- and size is pixelsize not pointsize
- and about the layer for objects being explictitly specified in properites of layer.
- make a note that the engine operates on degrees, but allegro draws in radians.
- make a note about layerrs and tmx mpa
- make a note aboutt physics objects only being created if layreri s named collision, also note that it doesnt matter where textrues and stuff in tmx path too because only the last file name in the path is used.
	- i.e. if in tmx map the path for tiles is "textures/tiles.png" the engine will process this as "tiles.png"
