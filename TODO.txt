some resource managers unique to a scene?
map hot reloading
code review

fix input stuttering (think its a dt thing).
fix map performance
input needs to be a system update / component?
text has incorrect bg
scrolling renders some objects transparent?
map will need to be layered from back-to-front to front-to-back as per opengl
some kind of conversion?

test culling now proper z sorting


have depth values in back-to-front, then convert to front-to-back range, then convert to normalized range.
this way its compatible with map and wont make brain hurty.
