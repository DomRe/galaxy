SUPERCLUSTER:
- physics tools (rigidbody tools).
- export to json / save as json
- documentation
- two states ("game") and ("editor")
	- play button switches between them.
	- serialzie data when swtiching, then load and run new scene. Clear on exit.
- fix encapsulation
- serialization
	- scene serialization
- audio support
- hot reloading
- on window focus (for viewport)
	- reload tile map from disk
- expose more to lua
- scene graph
	- entity heirachy
- rewrite serializer class

TODO:
- Fix CA and Compilation Warnings.
- Docs error fix.
- Dependencies should only abstract away system specific implementations.
- Loading state support?
	- Initial loading screen after window service is created, before other services.
- AI
- make sure default files are generated properly to prevent crashes.
- Add loaded/created flags for objects that use that model. i.e. sprite/texture/etc.
	- Log if u try without them.
- create component dependencies system where if a component is added the system checks if it is compatible/has right deps then ignores/adds.
	- component default data should safely create a component, no crash.
- further rendersystem improvements
convert type classes to enums (log, vertexs, etc...).
- fix audio encapsulation / scene integration
	- since its threaded
- collisonsystem should not need rendering information
- async log
- z ordering in spritebatches / in general / rendersystem / etc
- texture tooltip

IDE:
- MSVC CA
- CLANG TIDY
- CLANG FORMAT
- INCLUDE MANAGER


Supercluster is the game with an extra layer.
will need to export custom main and game layer.

EXPORTING:
- Engine will export a custom gamelayer and main.cpp along with a cmakelists file to build the game.
- that way supercluster will strip out the editorlayer when compiling.
- supercluster is just the game with an editor layer.
- strip out when exporting.
