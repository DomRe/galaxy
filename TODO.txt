Redshift:
- air resistance
- collision callbacks

STARMAP:
- move/copy constructors

QUASAR:
- C++20 review when eventual performance improvements are required.
- QuadTree spacial partitioning for rendering.

ALL:
- Investigate other usages of C++20 coroutines.
- See https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers/blob/master/cute_coroutine.h for ideas.
- Timer, StateMachine, Textbox, ThreadPool

DEV_TOOLS:
- physics tools
- export to json / save as json
- documentation
- cleanup
- 'static' cleanup

Galaxy:
- Restore data-driven design


THE PLAN:
- Every Class Should have a JSON & Lua interface.
- Need to integrate clang-tidy and clang-format.
- Need to integrate microsoft code analysis.
- Engine needs to be cohesive.
- Dependencies should only abstract away system specific implementations.
- Proper use of 'noexcept', 'static', and 'multithreading'.
- Use of coroutines over threading.
- Utilize GSL.
- All around CMAKE.
- Each class requires ability to be serialized -> prefereably to JSON or Lua.
- Async asset loading.
- namespaces for classification over filenames i.e. galaxy::SpriteComponent -> galaxy::components::renderable.
- rebrand to application programming framework.
- readme update
