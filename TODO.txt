	- allow for creating entities in lua.
	- even assigning components!
- fix category headers for v1.0.
- more physics shapes from tmx maps.

- split up doxygen documentation on rtfd and take advantage of toc.
	- refer to: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html	

- constexpr, sfinae, crtp
- reflect on box2d / or custom simple physics solution.
- move lua into system locator. use local variables over global variables.
- mapping improvements
- finish serializer
- need to move some loading code into load state not applicationo constuictor.
- support for languages? strings file im thinking...
- review automatic texture atlas texture loading
- add beter key config support
- add docs to testbox
- fix restart 
- ui:
	- add image support to tooltips.
	- shader support for ui -> specifically widgets?
		- pointer to shader object to use?
			- from sahder library?
	- list widget
	- tooltip support for all widgets -> make it part of widget, including recieving code?
	

    - sandbox notes:
		- loading screens between states
		- resources are loaded on a differnet thread
		- fix up and rewrite sandbox to test all parts of engine

    - serializable classes:
		- music
		- statemachine
		- animation
		- animationframe
		- registry in world.hpp
		- transformcomponent
		- physicscomponent
			- may need to update internal entity during deserialization
		- rendercomponent
		- animationcomponent
		- cameratag
		- vector2, vector3, rect (but as types so they can be serialized, not important to serialize each one at game save / load leave it up to where they are being used).
		- vector4
