- profile code for lag https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling
- test code for memory leaks
- review all compilation warnings
- integrate lua better

	https://sol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/cxx-in-lua.html
	https://sol2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/functions.html
	- allow for creating entities in lua.
	- even assigning components!
- fix category headers for v1.0.
- more physics shapes from tmx maps.
- split up doxygen documentation on rtfd and take advantage of toc.
	- refer to: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html	
- constexpr, sfinae, crtp
- reflect on box2d / or custom simple physics solution.
- mapping improvements
- finish serializer
- need to move some loading code into load state not applicationo constuictor.
- support for languages? strings file im thinking...
- threads?
- review automatic texture atlas texture loading
- add better key config support
- add docs to textbox
- ui:
	- shader support for ui -> specifically widgets?
		- pointer to shader object to use?
			- from sahder library?
	- list widget
	- tooltip support for all widgets -> make it part of widget, including recieving code?
	

- sandbox notes:
	- loading screens between states
	- resources are loaded on a differnet thread
	- fix up and rewrite sandbox to test all parts of engine

- serializable classes:
    - music
	- statemachine
	- animation
	- animationframe
	- registry in world.hpp
	- transformcomponent
	- physicscomponent
		- may need to update internal entity during deserialization
	- rendercomponent
	- animationcomponent
	- cameratag
	- vector2, vector3, rect (but as types so they can be serialized, not important to serialize each one at game save / load leave it up to where they are being used).
	- vector4
