AI:
- AStar

SUPERCLUSTER:
- physics tools
- export to json / save as json
- documentation
- VFS mount/unmount
- Use EACH() in supercluster for entity_ui.
- two states ("game") and ("editor")
- play button switches between them.
- serialzie data when swtiching, then load and run game state.

THE PLAN:
- Need to integrate clang-tidy and clang-format.
- Need to integrate microsoft code analysis.
- All around CMAKE.

- Launch tiled from unix.
- Restore data-driven design
- Engine needs to be cohesive.
- Async asset loading.
- Each class requires ability to be serialized -> prefereably to JSON or Lua.
- Use of coroutines over threading.

- Dependencies should only abstract away system specific implementations.
- coroutines

- Shader headers in graphics should be constexpr
- Loading state support?
- Application
- Serializer
- Serializable
