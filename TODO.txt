DEV_TOOLS:
- physics tools
- export to json / save as json
- documentation
- cleanup
- 'static' cleanup

THE PLAN:
- Need to integrate clang-tidy and clang-format.
- Need to integrate microsoft code analysis.
- All around CMAKE.

- Restore data-driven design
- Engine needs to be cohesive.
- Async asset loading.
- Each class requires ability to be serialized -> prefereably to JSON or Lua.
- Use of coroutines over threading.
- Proper use of 'noexcept', 'static', and 'multithreading'.
- Every Class Should have a JSON & Lua interface.
- Utilize GSL.
- Dependencies should only abstract away system specific implementations.
- coroutines
