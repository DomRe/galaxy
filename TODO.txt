- profile code for lag https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling
- test code for memory leaks
- review all compilation warnings
- integrate lua better

	- allow for creating entities in lua.
	- even assigning components!
- fix category headers for v1.0.
- more physics shapes from tmx maps.

- split up doxygen documentation on rtfd and take advantage of toc.
	- refer to: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html	

- write own ui.
- reflect on box2d / or custom simple physics solution.
- move lua into system locator. use local variables over global variables.
- ui should load from lua files maybe?
- mapping improvements
- finish serializer
- need to move some loading code into load state not applicationo constuictor.
- support for languages? strings file im thinking...
- review automatic texture atlas texture loading
- constexpr, sfinae, crtp


- ui:
	- add image and primitives support to tooltips.
	- shader support for ui
	- reduce update and event calcs...hardcode more of these values into widget.
	- slider should have callback function.
	- for slider: should recieve mouse move event and check for button press, so mousemovedevent needs unsigned int button value.
	- rename image to texture in arguments / params






    - sandbox notes:
		- loading screens between states
		- resources are loaded on a differnet thread
		- fix up and rewrite sandbox to test all parts of engine

    - serializable classes:
		- music
		- statemachine
		- animation
		- animationframe
		- registry in world.hpp
		- transformcomponent
		- physicscomponent
			- may need to update internal entity during deserialization
		- rendercomponent
		- animationcomponent
		- cameratag
		- vector2, vector3, rect (but as types so they can be serialized, not important to serialize each one at game save / load leave it up to where they are being used).
