- implement serialization
- need to document all classes aswell
- profile code for lags https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling
- fix up and rewrite sandbox to test all parts of engine
- static code analysis
- review all compilation warnings
- integrate lua better

	- allow for creating entities in lua.
	- even assigning components!

- fix category headers for v1.0.
- let debug menu load different levels
- entity creation scripts need to be generic
	- how many entitys to create of each type from each script
	- i.e. scripts are basicically templates for entity creation 
	- reemove concepts of unique entitys

- travis-ci / osx / linux builds
- ensure relevant classes are marked final noexcept
- improved documentation
- string view
- fix update method registry view iteration - in progress
- text loading from tmx maps
- review how entities are being stored - remove any of this - in progress
- further split logging into debug and release modes.
- optimise code
- fix physics entity creation in tmxmap + loading of physics scripts.
- create entities from nothing in debug manager
- review use of static keyword
- https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/8hmn0y/can_someone_give_me_a_practical_example/ -> ecs example usage 
- add ability to load a script into lua from debug menu
- add ability to write and save new scripts from script editor. -> just a popup box and an if_not_opened boolean -> then same saving code -> should be easy

fix level / state design (want to load / savebased off of an id)
