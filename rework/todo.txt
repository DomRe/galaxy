- allegro
- focus on RTTI
- clean up C++ code
- better documentation
- update copyrights
- includes
- better exceptions and logging
- https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Achieving_Resolution_Independence
- const / constexpr
- excess copying
- fix services destructors...
- quadtree bounds are level
- "collison rect" is rect that is camera
- only get entitys that are inside or border the "camera"

- atlas idea: https://github.com/Nooskewl/crystal-picnic/blob/master/src/atlas.cpp
- docs / readthedocs -> repo wiki / repo website / repo settings
- add systems to applciation
- may need to reposition allegro window //al_set_new_window_position(x, y);
	
- audio is now assosiated with systems and events
- loads from and audiomanager

renderer:
- only draw stuff that is in view - think quadtree
- camera system?
- split update and rendering threads?

- particle engine
- parallax
- implement serialization
	- call serializecomponetns from serailize suystem using eneityx
	- serializecomponents contain information about what this entity needs to load
	- use al_config format to easily support classes that require serialization

- achieve resolution independence
- camera

test:
- collision, physics systems & components
- box2d helper
- box2d manager
- shadermanager / shaders
- camera (implement first!)
- resolution independence (implement first!)

update physics quadtree according to camera positon -> means less to check
make some api calls have alternative shorthands.
e.g. Locator::get<World>()->m_systemManager to World::SystemManager()-> or something...
using typedefs maybe? or #defines?
