2D OpenGL Renderer in Modern C++.

## Usage:
See [documentation](https://domre.github.io/quasar/).

## Notes:
- Requires C++17 compatible compiler and OpenGL 4.5+ capable GPU.
- This was created as a method to learn OpenGL and professional Software Engineering processes. Nothing says this code isnt usable but be warned there is no support, and I am not responsible if you blow up your GPU.

## Building:
- Visual Studio 2019 project files provided for Windows.
- Mac OS is not supported due to Apple depreciating OpenGL.
- Unix support coming soon.

## Tests:
- Coming soon.
