/*
 Entitys ID used as insertion for std::vector so [entity] = components (but how to get which one?).
 components stored in groupings of type, assigned unique id, then paired with their entity.
 stored in std::vector
 

 so:
 std::vector<PackedComponents> with element being = entity.
 packed components = std::vector?



 So the element to be inserted is the type of component, then an array of those components of that type.
 the key is the type of component, the value is components of the same type, which is in a data structure, paired with an entity.
