TODO List:

beta2:
- proper loading system
- sfml inbuilt post-processing & shaders
- Debug gui using IMGUI
- improve map physics

beta3:
- ai
- Audio spacialization

v1.0:
- fix all warnings/errors
- recompile libraries on windows with vs2017
- proper credits file
- tile animations are waay to fast. also animation is drawn on top. need to implement better layering.
- tgui lua bridge


debug system has access to all entitys
debug system gui only when compiled in debug
rendered by sfml-imgui
use that to modify values of entitys - possibly then write them out to their lua files
