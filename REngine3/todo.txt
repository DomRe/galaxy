TODO List:

beta2:
- proper loading system
- sfml inbuilt post-processing & shaders
- Debug gui using IMGUI
- improve map physics
- fix bug when switching back into menu state from another state. I think it is to do with world not updating entitys but that isn't working for some reason...
- work through it logically...

beta3:
- ai
- Audio spacialization

v1.0:
- fix all warnings/errors
- recompile libraries on windows with vs2017
- proper credits file
- tile animations are waay to fast. also animation is drawn on top. need to implement better layering.
- tgui lua bridge


debug system has access to all entitys
debug system gui only when compiled in debug
rendered by sfml-imgui
use that to modify values of entitys - possibly then write them out to their lua files
save lua file data for componetns and send it to debug maanger for data reporting and allow modification / changes to components
from the debug manager and then write any changes out to lua files

components need to not jst use the data from lua files but save it for reuse later.
debug manager needs to load the entitys lua script into its system and modify that, then write it out afterwards.

the idea is you should be able to create and add a brand new entity to the engine from the debug menu. This allows you to do stuff in game without
having to recompile the game and the engine. ofc then this data is written out to the appropriate lua files by sol2. (gamestate.lua, entity.lua)
